# Graphshell Design Documentation

Graphshell is a spatial browser that represents webpages as nodes in a force-directed graph. Built on Servo, it provides a research tool for sense-making and exploratory workflows.

## Quick Start

**Build & Run**:

```bash
# Clone (if not already)
git clone https://github.com/servo/servo
cd servo
git checkout graphshell  # Fork by mark-ik

# Build (requires Python 3.8+, Rust 1.91+)
./mach build -r graphshell

# Run
./mach run -r graphshell -- https://example.com
```

For detailed setup, see **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)**. For implementation status, see **[ARCHITECTURAL_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURAL_OVERVIEW.md)**.

## Project Description

Graphshell is a spatial browser built on Servo's engine. Webpages are nodes in a force-directed graph, links are visible edges, and navigation happens by traversing the graph spatially. Users build mental maps of web structure through physical layout.

**Vision**: Enable serendipitous discovery, preserve browsing context, reduce tab chaos.

**Current Status**: Core browsing graph functional with egui_tiles multi-pane runtime complete. FT2 thumbnail/fallback rendering and FT6 graph search/filtering are now landed.

## Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: February 12, 2026
**Codebase**: `ports/graphshell/` (active desktop + graph runtime)

### What Works

- **Real browsing**: Servo webviews integrated, navigation creates nodes + edges
- **Graph visualization**: egui_graphs GraphView with zoom/pan/drag/selection
- **Physics**: Custom force-directed path currently active; migration plan targets egui_graphs force-directed integration next
- **Persistence**: fjall log + redb snapshots + rkyv serialization, survives restarts
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: T (physics), C (fit), P (config panel), N (new node), Home/Esc (view toggle), Del (remove)

### What's Next

- **Physics + selection simplification**: Replace custom physics/worker path and consolidate duplicated selection state. See [physics selection plan](implementation_strategy/2026-02-12_physics_selection_plan.md).
- **Selection semantics follow-up**: Keep reducer-driven selection metadata stable as the graph/tile architecture evolves.
- **FT2 thumbnail completion**: Landed (async capture, persistence, and thumbnail -> favicon -> color fallback).
- **Search/filtering (FT6)**: Landed (Ctrl+F search UI, nucleo fuzzy matching, highlight/filter, match navigation).

**See [ARCHITECTURAL_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURAL_OVERVIEW.md) for full details.**

## Build Info

**Platform**: Windows 11 (primary development)

**Requirements**:

- Rust 1.91.0+ (via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Python 3.8+ (mach wrapper)
- MozillaBuild (C++ toolchain for Servo dependencies)

**Build Times**:

- Clean build: ~15-30 min (depends on machine)
- Incremental: ~30s-2min (typical code change)
- Release build: +20% time vs debug

**Run Commands**:

```bash
# Debug build + run
./mach run -p graphshell

# Release build
./mach build --release -p graphshell
./mach run --release -p graphshell

# Build only (no run)
./mach build -p graphshell
```

See **[BUILD.md](BUILD.md)** for detailed setup.
